DarkRadiant
===========

DarkRadiant is a level (map) editor for the The Dark Mod, an open-source Doom 3
modification which is available at http://www.thedarkmod.com

Compiling on Windows
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

DarkRadiant is built on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 2013. 
The free Express version can be obtained here:

VC++ 2013: http://www.visualstudio.com/de-de/downloads
           (Choose Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop)

Since DarkRadiant uses a couple of open-source libraries that are not available on
Windows by default, you will also need to download and install the
dependencies. 7-Zip packages of the dependencies are available at the following
URL(s). (Get 7-zip here: http://www.7-zip.org/)

32-bit only builds:
https://github.com/codereader/DarkRadiant/releases/download/2.0.0/w32deps.7z

64-bit builds:
https://github.com/codereader/DarkRadiant/releases/download/2.0.0/w32deps.7z
https://github.com/codereader/DarkRadiant/releases/download/2.0.0/w64deps.7z

Note that 64-bit builds need the 32-bit dependencies in addition to their own
64-bit dependencies.

The dependencies packages need to be extracted into the main DarkRadiant
source directory, i.e. alongside the include/ and radiant/ directories.

Build
-----

The main Visual C++ solution file is:

Visual Studio 2013: tools/msvc2013/DarkRadiant.sln

Open this file with Visual Studio and start a build by right-clicking on the
top-level "Solution 'DarkRadiant'" item and choosing Build Solution.

Compiling on Linux
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile DarkRadiant, a number of libraries (with development headers) are
required. On an Ubuntu system, the requirements may include any or all of the
following packages:

zlib1g-dev 
libjpeg62-dev 
libwxgtk3.0-dev
libxml2-dev
libsigc++-2.0-dev
libpng12-dev
ftgl-dev
libglew-dev
libboost-dev
libboost-regex-dev
libboost-filesystem-dev 
libboost-python-dev
libboost-test-dev
libalut-dev 
libvorbis-dev 
python-dev

This does not include core development tools such as g++ or the git client
to download the sources (use sudo apt-get install git for that). One possible
set of packages might be:

sudo apt-get install git automake libtool g++ 

Build
-----

To build DarkRadiant the standard Autotools build process is used:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

The available configure options are listed with "./configure --help". There are
options for debug builds, and enabling or disabling various optional components
such as audio support and the Dark Mod-specific plugins.
